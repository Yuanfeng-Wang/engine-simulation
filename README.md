# Engine-Simulation
0D modeling of an internal combustion engine 

## TODO list
 - [ ] Scientific approach
   - [ ] put into equations the physical phenomenon (model reduction)
   - [ ] approach the modeling (in homogeneus volume and with the temporal variable)
   - [ ] carry out a sensitivity study
   - [ ] analysis of the results related with the assumptions

 - [ ] Numerical resolution
   - [ ] ...

 - [ ] Sensitivity and parametric studies
   - [ ] bring to light some limits of the modeling
